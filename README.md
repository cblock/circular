# Circular

Circular is a web app aimed at facilitating self-organization and shared decision making within organizations. 
It does so by helping people organize their ideas and share them with others in a way that gently nudges them into systems thinking and decision making inspired by sociocratic principles.

Why `circular`?
1.) It is an acknowledgement to the circle way methodology as a means of facilitating group communication.
2.) One of the corner stones of systems theory is the assumption that autopoietic systems are best described by their cylcic / circular dependencies
